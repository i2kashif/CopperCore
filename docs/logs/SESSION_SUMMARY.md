# CopperCore ERP - Session Summary
## Date: 2025-09-08

### Session Overview
**Objective**: Move from Step 1 (Login & Auth) to Step 2 (Manage Company - Organization Primitives)
**Status**: Planning complete, ready for implementation

### What We Accomplished

#### ✅ Step 1 Completion & UI Improvements
1. **Fixed Login Page UI Issues**
   - **Password Toggle Button**: Repositioned from `pr-3` to `pr-4`, adjusted input padding from `pr-12` to `pr-11`
   - **Load Failed Error**: Root cause was missing backend server, resolved by starting `pnpm dev:server` on port 3001
   - **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Successfully migrated from basic CSS to Tailwind CSS v4 with:
     - Modern gradient backgrounds
     - Enhanced form styling with better focus states
     - Professional loading animations
     - Password visibility toggle with eye icons
     - Responsive design improvements

2. **Infrastructure Updates**
   - Created new git branch: `feature/improve-login-ui`
   - Installed and configured Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS
   - Updated MCP guidelines to remove Supabase references from mandatory services
   - Both frontend (port 3003) and backend (port 3001) servers running successfully

#### ✅ Step 2 Planning (Current Focus)
3. **Comprehensive Implementation Plan Created**
   - Used `planning-coordinator` agent to create detailed 15-task breakdown
   - **Phase Structure**: Backend → Frontend → QA → Docs (following CLAUDE.md workflow)
   - **Agent Mapping**: Tasks assigned to architect-erp, backend-developer, frontend-developer, qa-test-engineer, docs-pm
   - **File-level Specifications**: All tasks under 500 LOC limit with specific file paths
   - **Acceptance Test Coverage**: AT-MGMT-001, AT-MGMT-002 mapped to implementation tasks

### Current State Analysis

#### Database Infrastructure ✅ Ready
- **Tables**: factories, users, user_factory_links already exist with proper constraints
- **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive Row-Level Security implemented in `009_create_rls_policies.sql`
- **JWT Functions**: Helper functions for `jwt_role()`, `user_is_global()`, etc. operational
- **Migrations**: All 11 migrations applied successfully

#### Authentication System ✅ Working
- Login flow functional with demo credentials (CEO: ceo/admin123)
- JWT token system operational
- Role-based access control enforced
- Factory scoping ready for Step 2 implementation

#### Development Environment ✅ Operational
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS on port 3003
- Backend: Express + PostgreSQL on port 3001
- Database: Local PostgreSQL with complete schema
- Tools: All MCP services configured and functional

### Next Steps (Ready for Execution)

#### Immediate Tasks
1. **BACKEND-1**: Create `/src/server/routes/company.ts` with factory management API
   - 6 endpoints: GET/POST/PUT for factories with CRUD operations
   - Event emissions: factory.created, factory.updated, etc.
   - RLS integration and validation
   - CEO/Director only access controls

2. **BACKEND-2**: Create user management API endpoints
   - User invitation, role assignment, factory linking
   - Deactivation/reactivation workflows

3. **FRONTEND-1**: Build ManageCompany component for CEO dashboard
   - Factory list with DataTable
   - Create/Edit factory dialogs
   - User management interface

#### Implementation Roadmap
- **Week 1**: Complete Backend Phase (Tasks 1-4)
- **Week 2**: Complete Frontend Phase (Tasks 5-9)  
- **Week 3**: Complete QA Phase (Tasks 10-13)
- **Week 4**: Documentation & DoD verification (Tasks 14-15)

### Key Requirements for Step 2

#### From Implementation Checklist
- **Backend**: Tables ✅, RLS ✅, Events (implementing), API endpoints (next)
- **Frontend**: CEO dashboard → Manage Company: factories list, create/edit, user invite & role assign
- **QA**: AT-MGMT-001 (FM cannot create factory/user), AT-MGMT-002 (CEO creates factory; user sees only assigned factory)
- **DoD**: New factory appears; scoping works end-to-end

#### From PRD v1.5 §5.12
- CEO/Directors can create factories and users
- Assign users to factories with proper role enforcement
- Add opening stock by lot with audit trail
- Factory scoping enforced in all queries and writes

### Technical Context
- **Context Usage**: 158k/200k tokens (79% - monitoring required)
- **Agent Types**: All 8 agent types ready and configured
- **MCP Services**: 49.3k tokens, fully operational
- **Background Processes**: Multiple dev servers running, ready for implementation

### Risk Management
- **Token Usage**: Approaching 80% - need to optimize agent prompts
- **Complexity**: Step 2 has 15 subtasks - need careful sequencing
- **Dependencies**: Some tasks depend on completion of backend API before frontend work

### Success Metrics
- All AT-MGMT-001/002 tests passing
- Factory CRUD operations working end-to-end
- Role-based access control verified
- Real-time UI updates functional
- Documentation complete and DoD achieved

**Next Action**: Execute BACKEND-1 task using backend-developer agent to create company management API endpoints.
