## 🏗️ Development Philosophy Established

**"UI-First with Solid Foundation"**

Rather than jumping into complex business logic, we're building a proper foundation:
- **Authentication First**: Users can log in and see appropriate interfaces
- **Admin Capabilities**: CEO can set up the company structure 
- **User Experience**: Multi-factory context switching works seamlessly
- **Real-time Infrastructure**: Live updates support all future features
- **Business Logic**: Inventory integrity with proper validation

This approach ensures each feature builds logically on the previous, creating a robust and maintainable system.
