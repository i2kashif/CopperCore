# CopperCore Feature Planning Execution Summary

## Actions Completed

### ✅ Action 0: CI/env Sanity Check
**Result:** No changes needed - CI environment already properly standardized
- Verified canonical environment variable names (DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) in use
- Existing check in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` validates against non-canonical names
- All workflow files using proper secret mappings

### ✅ Action 1: SESSION_CHECKLIST Focus (mgmt/checklist-focus branch)
**Result:** Successfully refactored SESSION_CHECKLIST.md with UI-first approach

**Changes Made:**
- **Consolidated Foundation**: Replaced 40+ housekeeping items with single line reference
- **Now (Next 5)**: Created priority implementation queue with UI-first progression:
  1. **UI-1**: Authentication System Foundation (Supabase Auth + factory selection + role-based routing)
  2. **UI-2**: Manage Company Dashboard (CEO: factories, users, factory assignments)
  3. **UI-3**: User Profile & Factory Context (factory switching, role display, session management)
  4. **F-6.1**: Realtime Infrastructure Foundation (entity-scoped channels + cache invalidation)
  5. **F-1.1**: WO Material Return Constraints (returns ≤ issued per lot + validation)
- **Logical Sections**: Reordered to Now → In Progress → Todo → Blocked → Done
- **Traceability**: Added PRD section references (§5.3, §12.1, etc.) and acceptance test IDs
- **UI Foundation Phase**: Added post-auth UI features (Product Family Management, SKU Catalog, Basic WO Creation)

### ✅ Action 2: Detailed GitHub Issues Plan
**Result:** Created comprehensive issue templates for all 5 priority features

**Created:** `github_issues_plan.md` with elaborate issue content including:

#### UI-1: Authentication System Foundation
- **Scope**: Supabase Auth, factory selection, role-based routing, session management
- **Files**: ~1200 lines across 9 components (AuthProvider, FactoryProvider, LoginForm, etc.)
- **Tests**: Unit (context management), Integration (JWT+RLS), E2E (login flow)

#### UI-2: Manage Company Dashboard  
- **Scope**: Factory CRUD, user management, assignment matrix, bulk operations
- **Files**: ~2000 lines frontend + 800 lines backend (CompanyDashboard, FactoryManagement, etc.)
- **Features**: CSV import, assignment history, permission validation

#### UI-3: User Profile & Factory Context
- **Scope**: Factory switcher, role display, preferences, session management
- **Files**: ~1000 lines (UserProfile, FactorySwitcher, permission hooks)
- **UX**: Header context display, keyboard shortcuts, context persistence

#### F-6.1: Realtime Infrastructure Foundation
- **Scope**: Entity-scoped channels, cache invalidation, Supabase integration
- **Files**: ~1500 lines frontend + 500 lines backend (ChannelManager, QueryInvalidator, etc.)
- **Architecture**: Connection management, subscription scoping, conflict resolution

#### F-1.1: WO Material Return Constraints
- **Scope**: Returns ≤ issued validation, business logic foundation, audit trail
- **Files**: ~1800 lines total (ReturnValidator, MaterialTransactionService, etc.)
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with detailed error responses (422 with quantity hints)

## Branch Status

### mgmt/checklist-focus
- **Status**: Ready for PR (commits pushed to origin)
- **Changes**: SESSION_CHECKLIST.md refactoring + GitHub issues plan
- **Next**: Create PR (stopped before merging per instructions)

## Ready for GitHub Issue Creation

All 5 priority features have detailed issue templates ready with:
- ✅ Problem/Solution breakdown with clear acceptance criteria  
- ✅ PRD references with specific sections and acceptance test IDs
- ✅ Technical implementation details with file structure estimates
- ✅ Test requirements (unit/integration/E2E) with coverage expectations
- ✅ Dependencies, risks, and mitigation strategies
- ✅ API design and backend integration requirements

## Next Steps (When Ready)

1. **Authenticate GitHub CLI** (`gh auth login`)
2. **Create Issues** using content from `github_issues_plan.md`
3. **Create PR** for SESSION_CHECKLIST changes: `mgmt/checklist-focus → main`
4. **Begin Implementation** starting with UI-1 (Authentication System Foundation)

## Development Approach Established

**UI-First Progression:**
```
Authentication → Company Management → User Profile → Realtime Infrastructure → Business Logic
```

This creates a logical foundation where each feature builds on the previous, starting with essential authentication and admin capabilities before moving to operational workflows.
