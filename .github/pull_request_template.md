## Approval Workflow

**If any critical path changes detected above:**

1. **Add Labels:** `Requires Approval` + specific labels (`rls-changes`, `pricing-changes`, etc.)
2. **Get Approvals:** 
   - üõ°Ô∏è Security Architect (for RLS, auth, security changes)
   - üëë CEO (for number series, pricing, major security changes)  
   - üí∞ Finance (for pricing changes)
   - üèóÔ∏è Architect (for migrations, schema changes)
3. **Complete Checklists:** All applicable checklist items above must be verified
4. **Documentation:** Update relevant ADRs, security docs, or compliance records
5. **Testing:** Enhanced test coverage for critical changes
6. **Staging Validation:** Deploy to staging and verify before production

**‚ö†Ô∏è Do not merge until all required approvals are obtained and checklists completed.**
